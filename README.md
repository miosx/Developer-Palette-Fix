# Developer Colour Palette iOS15 Crash Fix

On iOS15 [Developer Colour Palette](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/developer-colour-palette/id6447426581) will crash on launch.

It is all because using iOS16 SF Symbol "swatchpalette", so I change it to "paintpalette" by tweak way on jailbroken device.

Happy running on iOS15.
